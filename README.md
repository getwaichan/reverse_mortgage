A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 or older to borrow against their home's value without monthly payments, repayable when the property is sold, the homeowner passes away, or moves out permanently. Here's a structured summary:

Living Situation: Reverse mortgage holders can live in their homes until death. The loan terms typically do not force relocation unless the borrower no longer occupies it as their primary residence.
Loan Repayment: Upon the homeowner's death, the reverse mortgage becomes due. The estate must settle this debt, often by selling the property to repay the lender.
Moving Out Prematurely: If the borrower moves out (e.g., for long-term care), it may trigger immediate repayment, but as long as they remain in the home until death, no issues arise.
Estate Planning Considerations: The property remains under the homeowner's ownership until their death, after which it is used to settle the loan.
In summary, reverse mortgage holders can live in their homes until death, with repayment typically handled posthumously through the sale of the property.
